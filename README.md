## Description
---
This repository (“personal-portfolio”) is as described, a portfolio showcasing information for potential employers about me and my work, as well as a way to contact me. I was given the task of utilizing recently learned skills, including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables in this project. 

I chose to style my portfolio to give it a “code” look. As you’ll see, my about me section is formatted to look similarly to my html and css raw code. I wanted to set my portfolio up in a way that would correctly follow all the requirements for the project, but easy to read and change in the future as I create more projects and improve my skills through the course. I also chose to use blank placeholder images as my "applications." I don't currently have any applications made entirely by me, so as we progress through this course I will begin the process of swapping out my placeholder images and links for my legitimate applications coded by me! All placeholder images currently direct you to Google.
